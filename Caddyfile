# IMPORTANT: Replace example.com with your actual domain name
# Until you replace example.com with your real domain, HTTPS will show as "not secure"
# For Let's Encrypt to work, you MUST:
# 1. Own the domain you're using
# 2. Have DNS properly configured to point to your server
# 3. Have ports 80 and 443 open and accessible from the internet
